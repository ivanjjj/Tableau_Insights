**Summary:** From this dashboard, we can see that on average departure delats were highest in June (14 minute average), although the top 5 days with the highest average delay were all in December with December 30th being the highest at 36 average delay minutes\
**Design:** For time series data, a line graph is the easiest to interpret and get insights so this is the main chart on the display. There is also 2 two other useful charts on the right hand side.\

### Insight 2

**Summary:** On this pie chart, we can see that late aircraft delays are the biggest contributor to delays causing an average of 24 minutes of delay (delayed flights only). By selecting Hawaiian Airlines with the filter, we can see that the biggest contributor of delays is the airline delay rather than external factors.\
**Design:** A pie chart helps to visualise how each delay type contributes to the overall delay, and it is easy to see it for a specific airline by using a filter.\

### Insight 3

**Summary:** We can see on this bar chart that the worst airports with the highest average departure delay are Guam International Airport with an average of 63 minutes delay, followed by Eagle County Regional Aiport with an average of 45 minutes delay.\
**Design:** A bar chart makes it easy to see this type of data ranking different airports\
