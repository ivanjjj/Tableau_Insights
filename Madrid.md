### Insights

*Figure 1*

In figure 1, we can see that of the 3.18 million inhabitants in Madrid 12.1% of these are foreigners - this would be roughly 384,000 foreign inhabitants, which is a large population in of itself. The largest group with 40% of foreigners within Madrid is the 'Latin American and Caribbean' group, that's just over 150,000 inhabitants.

I got the main population data from the figures within the 'Madrid key metrics' section on the report. Within the same section, there is a 'National Distribution' donut chart with a light and dark gray section, 12.1% shows next to the dark gray portion which is the foreign population section. To the right of this, there is a horizontal bar chart showing "Foreign Poplation by Origin", this is where I got the data for the top bar with 'Latin American and Carribean'.

*Figure 2*

In figure 2, we have another interesting set of data. We can see based of this chart, that it's clear that the house prices within the area has a correlation with the percentage of votes for particular political parties. We can see that on average, the higher the house prices in the area, the more votes there are for the right wing parties.

This data came from the "Relation between 2015 house prices (€/m2) and votes to the 4 main parties in 2015 elections to City Hall" section of charts. This has 4 scatter plots, with votes to particular parties on the x axis and house prices by square metre on the y axis. The trend lines show the overall trend of each political party and I deduced the correlation from looking at these trend lines. The trend lines on the left wing parties is trending down - e.g. the lower the house prices, the higher the votes. On the right wing parties, this trend is the opposite.

*Figure 3*

Continuing with the theme of house prices, in figure 3 we can see the relation between house prices and car ownership within each neighbourhood. Higher car ownership appears to correlate with higher house prices within the neighbourhood. For example, San Cristóbel has about 25 cars per 100 inhabitants, and the house prices there are on average 925 euros per metre squared.

In the final chart on the report "Relation between house prices (€/m2) in 2015 and passenger cars per 100 inhabitants" there is a mixed line and bar chart. The x axis is showing the neighbourhood, and the y axis is showing the average number of cars per 100 inhabitants. The neighbourhoods are sorted by house prices with the highest on the left, and lowest on the right. I got the additional detail about San Cristóbel by clicking on the right most bar.
