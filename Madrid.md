In figure 2, we have another interesting set of data. We can see based of this chart, that it's clear that the house prices within the area has a correlation with the percentage of votes for particular political parties. We can see that on average, the higher the house prices in the area, the more votes there are for the right wing parties.

Continuing with the theme of house prices, in figure 3 we can see the relation between house prices and car ownership within each neighbourhood. Higher car ownership appears to correlate with higher house prices within the neighbourhood. For example, San Crist√≥bel has about 25 cars per 100 inhabitants, and the house prices there are on average 925 euros per metre squared.
